    1. Upgraded to MPAS V8.0.1

11/14/2023 Version 3.5

    1. Added support for reservation rtwrfruc on Jet.
    2. Upgraded fix file SOILPARM.TBL with latest WRF pacakge, especially for RUC LSM 
       with soil type 9.

11/01/2023 Version 3.4

    1. Incorporated fixes for diagnostic outputs when convection_scheme is turned off
       from the latest MPAS package within branch atmosphere/nssl_v7.3_smiol_lcc.
    2. Fixed a divide-by-zero float problem when computing 1-km hourly max reflectivity.
    3. Trimmed the docstring in scripts/run_mpas.sh.

08/24/2023 Version 3.3

    1. Added support for the RRFS-A North American datasets by converting
       the rotated lat/lon grid to the HRRR grid using wgrib2

       A new option "-i rrfsna" is added and it will depend the download
       RRFS-A NA data files from /lfs4/NAGAPE/wof/grib_files/RRFS-A.

06/20/2023 Version 3.2

    1. Added option config_microp_re following Ted's suggestion
    2. Updated static processing with new BNU soil type and parallel
       processing capability
    3. Separated subdirectory fix_files from templates.

05/12/2023 Version 3.1

    1. Fixed bug with hourly precipitation in convective_diagnostics.F.
    2. Improved resource usage on Jet.
    3. Used 768 core for jobs of ICs and LBCs instead of 800.
    4. Improved python scripts of plotting, especially for plotting precipitation fields.

    new executables:
       atmosphere_model.single
       init_atmosphere_model

04/28/2023 Version 3.0

    1. Bill implemented the analysis fields wind rotation in the MPAS init_atmosphere core
    2. Fix output of various UH values and 1-km max reflectivity
    3. Fix for RUC LSM soil moisture issues

    new executables:
       atmosphere_model.single
       init_atmosphere_model

04/26/2023 Version 2.0

    Here are the main updates:

    1. Upgrade the PNETCDF library because MPAS uses a feature that is not available with version 1.6;
    2. Add a wgrib2 step to rotate winds for the HRRR datasets;
    3. Process wgrib2 & ungrib in parallel mode for speedup;
    4. RRFS-initialized MPAS runs up to 60 hours

    new executables:
       atmosphere_model.single
       init_atmosphere_model
       ungrib.exe

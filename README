04/26/2023 Version 2.0

    Here are the main updates:
    1. Upgrade the PNETCDF library because MPAS uses a feature that is not available with version 1.6;
    2. Add a wgrib2 step to rotate winds for the HRRR datasets;
    3. Process wgrib2 & ungrib in parallel mode for speedup;
    4. RRFS-initialized MPAS runs up to 60 hours

    new executables: 
       atmosphere_model.single
